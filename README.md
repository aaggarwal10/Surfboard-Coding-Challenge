# Surfboard-Coding-Challenge-Frontend
This is my submission for the Surfboard Coding Challenge. I created a [webapp](https://surfboardcodingchallenge.anishaggarwal.ca) that allows users to schedule agendas and meetings with topics and descriptions. It is connected to Zoom via there API, allowing individuals to join calls for each agenda item (Refer to the [backend repo](https://github.com/aaggarwal10/Surfboard-Coding-Challenge-Backend/tree/master) for the code implementations of the Zoom API). Finally, I used a simple FirebaseStore DB to store all of the meetings, topics, and zoom links allowing anyone to create, edit, and delete agenda items. Finally, here is a [video demo](https://www.loom.com/share/5a8461b992424ef6b577e3c842f71a94) of the application.
